UPGRADE

Upgrading from version older than 3.5.0 is not supported anymore. If you
had an older version you need to install Newscoop 3.5.0 and upgrade to this
version.

Warning! Backup your site before performing the upgrade!

Upgrading from Newscoop 3.5.x:

Drop the new sources over the existing install, open a browser and make
a request for the publication home page:
http://[site_name]

The upgrade will be performed automatically when you make the first
request to the publication site or to the Newscoop admin interface.

After upgrading, you need to MANUALLY update .htaccess file in your 
Newscoop directory. Change the following line:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/+templates

by this line:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/+themes

The reason why this is not performed during automatic upgrade is because
almost every Newscoop installation is on a custom configuration and has a
modified .htaccess file. Therefore, it's not a good idea to automatically
modify the file.

Compatibility issues

In version 3.0 the template language was modified extensively. The
backup restore script will provide an automated conversion of the old
template files to the new format. For more details on language changes
please read the manual.

The template language is fully backward compatible with the older 3.x
versions.


Troubleshooting

In version 3.5.3 the "javascript" directory was renamed to "js" due to
naming issues with the specific implementation of Apache in Ubuntu. As a
consequence you can experiment some mis-behaviors like the TinyMCE editor
not loading in the Article edit screen. For this to be fixed, the .htaccess
file must be upgraded. The automatic upgrade script tries to modify the
file for you, it only works though if .htaccess is writable, otherwise you
must edit it by yourself. All what you need to do is to change the
following line:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(/+plugins/[^/]*)?/+javascript

by

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(/+plugins/[^/]*)?/+js
