UPGRADE

Upgrading from versions 1.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x, 2.4.x and
2.5.x is not supported anymore. You will have to upgrade first to
Newscoop 2.6 or 2.7 and then follow the regular procedure.

Upgrading from Newscoop 2.6.x and 2.7.x versions:
Repeat the following steps for each instance:

1. Backup the instance using newscoop-backup
2. Perform a new Newscoop 3.5 install
3. Run the restore backup script from the admin interface


Read INSTALL.txt file and follow the steps; read on Compatibility issues.

Upgrading from Newscoop 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 3.2.x, 3.3.x and 3.4.x:

Drop the new sources over the existing install, open a browser and make
a request for the publication home page:
http://[site_name]

The upgrade will be performed automatically when you make the first
request to the publication site or to the Newscoop admin interface.


Compatibility issues

In version 3.0 the template language was modified extensively. The
backup restore script will provide an automated conversion of the old
template files to the new format. For more details on language changes
please read the manual.

The template language is fully backward compatible with the older 3.x
versions.


Troubleshooting

In version 3.5.3 the "javascript" directoy was renamed to "js" due to
naming issues with the specific implementation of Apache in Ubuntu. As a
consequence you can experiment some mis-behaviors like the TinyMCE editor
not loading in the Article edit screen. For this to be fixed, the .htaccess
file must be upgraded. The automatic upgrade script tries to modify the
file for you, it only works though if .htaccess is writable, otherwise you
must edit it by yourself. All what you need to do is to change the
following line:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(/+plugins/[^/]*)?/+javascript

by

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(/+plugins/[^/]*)?/+js
