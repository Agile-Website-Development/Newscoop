  Work flow:

A) upload page
    0) take user email, data file, file type
    1) check if the file is of a known format
    2) move the file into a directory
    3) put path, type, email into mysql
        * set status into 'init'
    4) call import script

B) import script
    0) run by cron / web page
    1) check if another script runs (via lock files)
        * exit if other run (or if more than limit)
    2) cycle over mysql queue
        a) take (path, type, email) from mysql
            * update row status into 'work'
        b) exit (release lock) if no request there
            * could omiting a request theoretically, thus cron runs too
        c) make the cms->newsml conversion
        d) update row status into 'sent'
        e) send email to the user with download link
        f) remove the original file

C) download page
    1) take provided file id
    2) serve the file of that id if exists

D) crons
    a) for import scripts
    b) for removing old filed and old db rows


Note that the count of concurrent running scripts is limited to two,
one from web server, one from cron. This can be changed, if requested.
